Scott Pilgrim vs. the World cast will reunite for Netflix anime series. Plus, trailers for Dead Ringers, Barry season 4, and more of the biggest news in TV and streaming.\n\nTOP STORY\nAn X-Files Reboot Series Is in the Works from Wakanda Forever Director Ryan Coogler\n(Photo by Arnold Turner/Getty Images for Essence)\nRyan Coogler, writer-director of the Black Panther films and Creed, is planning to \u201cremount\u201d The X-Files, original show-creator Chris Carter revealed to Gloria Makarenko on an episode of CBC\u2019s On the Coast.\nDuring a conversation celebrating the 30th anniversary of the beginning of production of the hit paranormal series, Carter spoke of how today\u2019s obsession with conspiracy theories would inform a new version on the program, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re so steeped in conspiracies now. The X-Files\u00a0dealt with a\u00a0central conspiracy, but now the world is so full of conspiracies that I think that it would be a different show.\u201d\nCarter then dropped the news of Coogler\u2019s new take on the program: \u201cI just spoke to a young man, Ryan Coogler, who is going to remount\u00a0The X-Files with a diverse cast. So, he\u2019s got his work cut out for him because we covered so much territory.\u201d\nThe X-Files starred David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson as government agents solving otherworldly cases, while constantly searching for the truth. The series originally aired on Fox from 1993 to 2002, spawned two movies, and returned to the network with a 10th and 11th season dropping in 2016 and 2018, respectively.\n\n While Lotus Heads to Thailand for Season 3\n(Photo by HBO)\nMike White\u2019s \u00a0hit HBO series The White Lotus is heading to Thailand, sources close to the production revealed to Variety.\nWhite previously alluded that the third installment of the anthology would head to Asia, saying in the \u201cUnpacking S2 E7\u201d tied to the finale of season 2, \u201cThe first season kind of highlighted money, and then the second season is sex,\u201d White said in a clip pegged at the end of the season 2 finale. \u201cI think the third season would be maybe a satirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality. It feels like it could be a rich tapestry to do another round at White Lotus.\u201d\nProduction on the new season hasn\u2019t started yet, meaning the story and cast have not been revealed. However, Friends alum Jennifer Aniston is pitching herself as a worthy addition to the franchise.\n\nNew Trailers: Rachel Weisz and Rachel Weisz Test Medical Boundaries in Prime Video\u2019s Dead Ringers \n\nRachel Weisz pulls double duty in Prime Video\u2019s twisted thriller Dead Ringers.\nThe reimagining of David Cronenberg\u2019s 1988 psychosexual classic, which starred Jeremy Irons as renowned twin gynecologists Elliott and Beverly Mantle, finds Weisz putting a female twist on the characters.\nFollowing the blueprint of the movie, Weisz\u2019s ob-gyn twins share everything: drugs, lovers, and a drive to move women\u2019s healthcare practices into the 21st century, pushing ethical boundaries in the name of progress.\nBritne Oldford, Poppy Liu, Michael Chernus, Jennifer Ehle, and Emily Meade also star.\nDead Ringers will answer that question when all six episodes of season 1 drop on Friday, April 21 on Prime Video.\n\nSee Also: Everything We Know About Marvel\u2019s Secret Invasion \u2014 See the New Trailer!\n\nMore trailers and teasers released this week:\n\u2022 Florida Man follows a struggling ex-cop (Edgar Ram\u00edrez) forced to return to his home state of Florida to find a Philly mobster\u2019s runaway girlfriend.

(Deadline)\n\nGLAAD Report: LGBTQ Representation on TV Slightly Lower in 2022-2023 Season\n\nAccording to GLAAD\u2019s 18th annual \u201cWhere We Are on TV\u201d report, LGBTQ representation on television is down. Counted in the report are 596 regular and recurring LGBTQ characters who appear (or will appear) on shows across broadcast, cable, and streaming from June 1, 2022 through to May 31, 2023. The previous year found 637 LGBTQ characters appearing on television, marking -6.44percent decrease.\nRepresentation is still thriving on streaming, with 356 LGBTQ characters appearing on Apple TV+, Amazon Prime, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, Peacock, and Paramount+. There were decreases across the board on broadcast in the percentage of LGBTQ series regulars from the previous report. That said, The CW still holds the top spot 14.8% of all series regulars being LGBTQ. Still, that is down -2.3 percent. The changed ownership of the network is acknowledged as a potential cause for the dip.\nOf LGBTQ characters, 175 (29 percent of the 596) will not be returning due to multiple reasons: their shows are ending, a character is dying or leaving a show, or a program that features LGBTQ characters is presented in a miniseries/anthology format. Of that number, 140 characters will disappear due to series cancellations or their respective shows coming to an end.\nYou can view the full \u201cWhere We Are on TV\u201d report here.\n\nOn an Apple device?

That could be because we have some very interesting films that look great but span very different genres, from a family-friendly animated video game movie to a historical sports drama and at least one movie that defies easy categorization. \u00a0Read on for the most anticipated movies of April 2023!\n\n\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\n(2023)\n\n\n#1 on Twitter and YouTube, #2 on Facebook and Instagram\nRelease Date: April 5\nThe race for No. 1 this week was a bit of a toss-up between three movies, but one in particular just nudged out the other two, and that, unsurprisingly, was Universal and Illumination\u2019s highly anticipated new animated film based on Nintendo\u2019s favorite plumber. Sure, there was some grumbling about Chris Pratt voicing Mario, but the animation looks gorgeous, fans have been waiting for the film for a long time, and there is so much good will built up around this character and the world he inhibits that it could only end up at the top of this month\u2019s list.\n\n\n\nEvil Dead Rise\n(2023)\n\n\n#1 on Facebook, #2 on YouTube, #3 on Instagram and Twitter\nRelease Date: April 21\n\nThere was a very small margin between No. 2 and No. 3 on this month\u2019s list, but in the end, this new chapter in the Evil Dead franchise prevailed. The 2013 reboot earned something of a cult following, but no one could have expected the reception this film got when it premiered at SXSW in March. So far, the film, which focuses on a pair of estranged sisters who are terrorized by \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a demonic book of the occult, is a hit with critics and hopefully should make for a worthy addition to the series.\n\n\n\nBeau Is Afraid\n(2023)\n\n\n#1 on Instagram, #2 on Twitter, #3 on Facebook, #4 on YouTube\nRelease Date: April 21\nComing in right on the heels of Evil Dead Rise is this curiosity from Ari Aster, a director who, in fact, has himself made his name in horror. We\u2019re not quite sure what to make of Beau Is Afraid, however; it appears to pull from multiple genres, including horror, to deliver its decades-spanning tale of a man named Beau (Joaquin Phoenix) simply making the journey home to see his mother. The combination of Aster and Phoenix alone makes this a must-see, but the trippy visuals and surreal tone of the film make it that much more intriguing.\n\n\n\nAir\n(2023)\n\n\n#4 on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter; #5 on YouTube\nRelease Date: April 5\n\nBen Affleck and Matt Damon reunite for this based-on-true-events sports drama about the men who worked for Nike back in the early \u201980s when the burgeoning shoe company was looking to sign a certain signature athlete to its new line of basketball shoes. This is another film that debuted at South by Southwest and earned massive rave reviews, and the combination of the talent involved and the pop culture cachet of the subject matter have propelled it to No. 4 on our list.\n\n\n\nRenfield\n(2023)\n\n\n#3 on YouTube, #5 on Instagram\nRelease Date: April 14\n\nComing in at the final slot of this month\u2019s list is another genre-bender, though this one leans a bit more into the \u201ccomedy\u201d of its horror-comedy. Nicholas Hoult stars as the eponymous Renfield, the assistant to Nicolas Cage\u2019s Count Dracula, who\u2026 Let\u2019s be honest: The phrase \u201cNicolas Cage\u2019s Count Dracula\u201d probably tells you almost everything you need to know to determine whether or not to watch the film. Just be aware that, despite its seemingly fun and silly trappings, you\u2019re going to see some gory stuff. You know, the \u201chorror\u201d part of the horror-comedy.\n\nThumbnail by \u00a9Universal Pictures\nOn an Apple device?

None of its sequels lasted longer than a single week at No. 1 due to competition, and the latest franchise attempt is likely to suffer the same fate next week as a new video game adaptation takes over. Nevertheless, March produced three $100+ million grossers, two of which are headed over $150 million and one that\u2019s still shooting for $200 million. Will they be joined by a fourth? The new Dungeons & Dragons film certainly has its supporters from both its fandom and even critics, but its opening numbers likely aren\u2019t impressing those who put up the dough for it.\n\nKing of the Crop: D&D: Honor Among Thieves Dethrones\u00a0John Wick\n\nSo what are we to make of a $38.5 million weekend by Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves? Fans of number-watching got excited on Friday morning when some reported a $5.6 million take in Thursday previews. Those would have been the best Thursday numbers of the year. Alas, those reports buried the lede that $1.5 million of that was from earlier previews. Thus the potential estimates for a huge weekend were dashed. Still, those are better numbers than Shazam! Fury of the Gods, right? Well, yes and no.\nYes, $38.5 million is a higher number than the $30 million that DC dud limped out of the gate with (and certainly higher than the $33.9 million the 2000 attempt at this franchise made \u2013 and that\u2019s globally). On the other hand, an extra $8.5 million is not much to write home about when your film costs anywhere from $26-41 million more than one that is already poised to be one of the biggest bombs of 2023. It\u2019s all up to fans now to spread word of mouth, especially overseas where this film really needs to be saved.\nThe numbers this weekend put Honor Among Thieves behind the company of three late March releases \u2013 Ready Player One ($41.7 million opening), G.I. Joe: Retaliation ($40.5 million), and 2017\u2019s Power Rangers ($40.3 million). That latter comes up a lot when measuring franchise failures, as it barely doubled its opening weekend towards a $85.3 million gross. Spielberg\u2019s film and the G.I. Joe sequel domestically grossed $137.6 million and $122.5 million, respectively. They also had solid international hauls of $445.2 million and $253.2 million. Yet, with their budgets of $175 million & $130 million, they were still considered disappointments overall. Somewhere in there are the numbers that the $151 million-budgeted D&D needs to turn a theatrical profit; so far, it has grossed just $71.5 million worldwide.\n\nThe Top 10 and Beyond: John Wick: Chapter 4 and\u00a0Scream VI Set Sights on Franchise Milestones\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4 fell 61.8% in its second weekend down to $28.2 million; that\u2019s just a bit over Chapter 3\u2019s $24.5 million over its second frame. Currently, the fourth chapter is at $122.8 million and about $21 million ahead of its predecessor\u2019s pace. Chapter 3 ultimately finished with $171 million, putting the new film on a very narrow path to $200 million. If it wants to keep chugging ahead of the last film\u2019s pace, it will need to earn at least around $15 million next week. Chapter 4 now owns the 12th-best 10-day total for a film released in March, but it\u2019s also behind the pace of Jordan Peele\u2019s Us, which had a $33.2 million second outing and $127.8 million after 10 days to finish with $175 million. Us dropped off further in weekend three, so if the word of mouth is out there, Wick can push further, but right now it\u2019s looking like it will land somewhere between $180-195 million. In the meantime, it is over $245 million worldwide.\nCreed III made another $5 million in its fifth weekend, bringing its total up to $148.5 million (and over $255 million worldwide). The film is still falling off the pace of Kong: Skull Island but could still tiptoe its way to just over $160 million. Scream VI is just shy of the $100 million line, which it will cross this week and ultimately land between $105-110 million to make it the highest-domestic-grossing film in the franchise. With $143 million worldwide, it still needs another $30 million to top the global gross of the 1996 original.\n\nTucked into third this week is a release from faith-based Angel Studios called His Only Son, about the story of Abraham being called to sacrifice his son, Isaac. $5.5 million went into the collection plate a week before Easter. That outgrossed Zachary Levi in Shazam! Fury of the Gods in just its third weekend; it made $4.6 million, bringing its total to $53.4 million. Another DC Zach \u2013 Snyder, that is \u2013 debuted in 2004 with his remake of Dawn of the Dead, which had a $4.5 million third weekend. It had $51.7 million in the bank after 17 days and finished with $59 million, suggesting Fury of the Gods is going to get itself just over the $60 million line and join the $100+ million loser club. That and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, down to $1.2 million in week seven, are the two biggest money losers of the year, though they could be joined by Dungeons & Dragons if its international sales don\u2019t pick up.\nWrapping up the top 10, Jesus Revolution finished its sixth weekend by getting over $50 million, Sony\u2019s sci-fi disappointment 65 managed to cross $30 million, and Focus\u2019 Sundance winner A Thousand and One grossed $1.8 million in 926 theaters. Then, outside the top 10, Zach Braff\u2019s A Good Person with Florence Pugh expanded to 687 theaters from just 157 a week ago and grossed $510,210. It has made $1.7 million in 10 days of release. Braff\u2019s crowd-funded Sundance effort, Wish I Was Here, grossed $3.59 million in 56 days of release in 2014.\n\nOn the Vine:\u00a0The Super Mario Bros.

We saw Warner Bros. commit to streaming all of their major 2021 releases simultaneously on HBO Max, with mixed results, while other studios incorporated some combination of theatrical and digital strategies. That probably isn\u2019t going to change going into 2023, but it doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have some incredible films to look forward to.

It didn\u2019t kill anyone, but that didn\u2019t stop a bunch of folks taking some creative liberties to give us this tongue-in-cheek horror comedy.\n\nMarch\n\n\n\nCreed III\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Michael B. Jordan\nStarring: Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson, Jonathan Majors, Phylicia Rashad\nOpening on: March 3, 2023\nMichael B. Jordan makes his feature directorial debut with the third installment of the\u00a0Rocky spin-off\u00a0Creed franchise, in which he plays the son of Rocky\u2019s nemesis-turned-friend Apollo Creed.

Hayden Panettiere also returns to reprise her role as Kirby Reed from Scream 4, but the film will be without franchise star Neve Campbell, who decided not to return after she was offered less than she felt she was worth for the film. As for the story, sisters Sam and Tara (Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega) and their friends find themselves terrorized by Ghostface in New York City.\n\n\n\n\nShazam! Fury of the Gods\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: David F.

We don\u2019t know much about the film, except that John Wick is at war with \u2014 and possibly presumed dead by \u2014 the High Table, and Stahelski has gone on record to say that there is a possibility that\u00a0Chapter 4 will not be a \u201chappy ending\u201d for its central character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected by: John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein\nStarring: Chris Pine, Hugh Grant, Reg\u00e9-Jean Page, Michelle Rodriguez, Sophia Lillis, Smith\nOpening on: March 31, 2023\nThe popular role-playing game gets a shiny reboot, courtesy of directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein (Game Night, 2015\u2019s\u00a0Vacation) and an all-star cast that includes Chris Pine,\u00a0 Michelle Rodriguez, Hugh Grant, Bridgerton breakout star Reg\u00e9-Jean Page, and more.\n\n\n\n\nTetris\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Jon S. Baird\nStarring: Taron Egerton, Nikita Efremov, Toby Jones\nOpening on: March 31, 2023\nSimilar to Gran Turismo, also opening later in 2023, this is a based-on-true-events biopic, of sorts, rather than a straight adaptation of the game in its title.\u00a0Tetris tells the story of how one man (Taron Egerton) took immense risks at the height of the Cold War to travel to the Soviet Union and secure the rights to the eponymous game.\n\nApril\n\n\n\nAir\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Ben Affleck\nStarring: Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Jason Bateman, Viola Davis, Chris Tucker, Chris Messina, Marlon Wayans\nOpening on: April 5, 2023\nBen Affleck returns to the director\u2019s chair for this based-on-true-events sports drama about Nike\u2019s quest to land Michael Jordan as the signature superstar for its fledgling basketball shoe line. The rest, of course, is history. Affleck also stars as Nike co-founder Phil Knight, alongside Matt Damon as Sonny Vaccaro, the marketing exec who landed the deal, and an all-star supporting cast.\n\n\n\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Aaron Horvath, Michael Jelenic\nStarring: Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jack Black, Charlie Day, Seth Rogen, Fred Armisen, Keegan-Michael Key\nOpening on: April 7, 2023\nThis big-screen adaptation of the iconic Nintendo character and his friends is being produced by Chris Meledandri of Illumination (Despicable Me) and the creator of Mario himself, Shigeru Miyamoto. Chris Pratt is voicing the famous Goomba-stomping plumber, who arrives in the Mushroom Kingdom and meets Keegan-Michael Key\u2019s Toad. Anya Taylor-Joy is also on board as Princess Peach, while Jack Black and Seth Rogen will voice Bowser and Donkey Kong, respectively, and Charlie Day will play Luigi.\n\n\n\n\nBeau Is Afraid\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Ari Aster\nStarring: Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Ryan, Nathan Lane, Parker Posey, Patti LuPone, Stephen Henderson\nOpening on: April 21, 2023\nWriter-director Ari Aster\u2019s third film is\u2026 difficult to describe, though its official synopsis states that it is \u201can epic odyssey\u201d of a man trying to \u201cget home to his mother\u201d that is \u201cbold and ingeniously depraved.\u201d We have absolutely no idea how this will play out, but the trailer promises a unique, surreal experience.\n\n\n\n\nEvil Dead Rise\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Lee Cronin\nStarring: Alyssa Sutherland, Lily Sullivan, Gabrielle Echols, Morgan Davies, Neil Fisher\nOpening on: April 21, 2023\nOriginally slated to be an HBO Max release in the Fall of 2022, the fifth film in the\u00a0Evil Dead franchise is now headed to theaters in April. The story, which moves the action from the woods to the city, focuses on two estranged sisters whose reunion is interrupted by \u2013 what else? \u2013 the discovery of a mysterious book that summons demons. The film doesn\u2019t appear to be connected to any of the previous entries, including the 2013 remake, but it promises plenty of blood-soaked thrills.\n\n\n\n\nGhosted\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Dexter Fletcher\nStarring: Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, Adrien Brody, Mike Moh, Amy Sedaris, Tim Blake Nelson, Marwan Kenzari\nPremiering on: April 21, 2023 on Apple TV+\nFrom the writers of the\u00a0Deadpool movies and the director of\u00a0Bohemian Rhapsody comes this action rom-com about a regular guy (Chris Evans) who travels to London as a grand gesture to win over the girl who ghosted him (Ana de Armas), only to discover she\u2019s a CIA agent and get tangled up in her latest mission.\n\n\n\n\nGuy Ritchie's The Covenant\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Guy Ritchie\nStarring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Dar Salim, Alexander Ludwig, Antony Starr, Emily Beecham\nOpening on: April 21, 2023\nAside from his forays into franchise fare and big-budget tentpoles, Guy Ritchie is known for his trademark talky crime capers, but his latest showcases a different side of the writer-director. Jake Gyllenhaal stars in this serious action thriller about a special ops veteran who returns to Afghanistan to find the interpreter who previously rescued him and carried him to safety.\n\nMay\n\n\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: James Gunn\nStarring: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Klmentieff, Will Poulter, Elizabeth Debicki\nOpening in: May 5, 2023\nWriter-director James Gunn\u2019s follows his giddily irreverent 2021 effort The Suicide Squad with the latest Guardians, which is sure to have a winning Chris Pratt, an awesome mix \u2014 see what we did there? \u2014 of other actors, and, we\u2019re just guessing, plenty of comedic hijinks. We also know that Will Poulter is set to play Adam Warlock, who was teased at the end of Vol. 2.\n\n\n\n\nFast X\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Justin Lin\nStarring: Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Sung Kang, Ludacris, Nathalie Emmanuel\nOpening on: May 19, 2023\nThis is only part one of the tenth installment of the most speedy and angry franchise out there. (Part two, rumored to be the last in the series, will drop in 2024.) And while the plot is hush-hush at the moment, we know that Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and the rest of the family\u00a0will be back to do their thing.\n\n\n\n\nThe Little Mermaid\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Rob Marshall\nStarring: Halle Bailey, Jonah Hauer-King, Melissa McCarthy, Javier Bardem, Daveed Diggs, Awkwafina\nOpening on: May 26, 2023\nThis live-action remake of Disney\u2019s fish-out-of-water favorite has some inspired casting \u2014 in particular, Melissa McCarthy (Ursula), Awkwafina (Scuttle), and Javier Bardem (King Triton) \u2014 and new tunes co-written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, while pop star Halle Bailey will don some fins to play Ariel.\n\nJune\n\n\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n(2023)\n\nDirected by:\u00a0Joaquim Dos Santos\nStarring: Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar Isaac, Issa Rae\nOpening on: June 2, 2023\nThe Oscar-winning animated\u00a0Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u00a0was a big hit with critics and audiences, and Across the Spider-Verse was one of the most anticipated of 2022\u2026 until it got moved to 2023. Shameik Moore will voice Miles Morales again, with Hailee Steinfeld\u2019s Gwen Stacy and Oscar Isaac\u2019s Miguel O\u2019Hara (aka Spider-Man 2099) joining him. We also know that Issa Rae is set to voice Jessica Drew (aka Spider-Woman), and it\u2019s likely that Jake Johnson\u2019s Peter Parker will be back as well. The first trailer didn\u2019t give us a whole lot more on the actual story of the film, but it revealed a whole slew of Spider characters Miles will come into contact with.\n\n\n\n\nTransformers: Rise of the Beasts\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Steven Caple Jr.\nStarring: Ron Perlman, Anthony Ramos, Peter Cullen, Dominique Fishback, Luna Lauren Velez\nOpening on: June 9, 2023\nThe\u00a0Transformers franchise takes another step back in time after the 1980s-set\u00a0Bumblebee, taking viewers back to the mid-\u201990s as a pair of archaeologists stumble into a three-way conflict between different factions of Transformers. The film is loosely based on the\u00a0Beast Wars storyline and directed by Steven Caple Jr. (Creed II), with Peter Cullen reprising his role as the voice of Optimus Prime and people like Ron Perlman, Anthony Ramos, and Dominique Fishback joining the cast.\n\n\n\n\nElemental\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Peter Sohn\nStarring: Leah Lewis, Mamoudou Athie\nOpening on: June 16, 2023\nThe latest offering from Pixar takes place in a city whose residents belong to the elements of fire, water, land, and air, where one fiery woman forms a friendship with a watery man. We don\u2019t know much else about the story, but the film is directed by Peter Sohn, who also helmed 2015\u2019s\u00a0The Good Dinosaur.\n\n\n\nExtraction 2\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Sam Hargrave\nStarring: Chris Hemsworth, Golshifteh Farahani, Adam Bessa\nPremiering on: June 16, 2023 on Netflix\nNot long after the pandemic took hold of the world in 2020, Netflix released an ambitious, adrenaline-fueled action flick starring Chris Hemsworth called\u00a0Extraction, directed by Sam Hargrave and written by Joe Russo (and based on a graphic novel that Russo co-wrote). All three have returned for this sequel, which promises more ridiculous stunts and set pieces you can enjoy from the comfort of your living room couch.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Flash\n(2023)\n\n\nDirected by:\u00a0Andy Muschietti\nStarring:\u00a0Ezra Miller, Ben Affleck, Sasha Calle, Billy Crudup, Michael Keaton\nOpening on: June 16, 2023\nMulti-verses were all the rage in 2022, and this movie looks to be DC\u2019s contribution to the trend. Like a lot of the films on this list, we don\u2019t yet know anything about the story, but the casting of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne is either a super meta stunt or a big hint as to what we\u2019ll see. There are rumors that the plot will follow the \u201cFlashpoint\u201d storyline from the comics, in which case, yes, expect some crossover shenanigans.\n\n\n\n\nAsteroid City\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Wes Anderson\nStarring: Jason Schwartzman, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Tom Hanks, Jeffrey Wright, Bryan Cranston, Ed Norton, Adrien Brody, Liev Schreiber, Margot Robbie, Steve Carell\nOpening on: June 23, 2023\nWes Anderson has gathered another ridiculously star-studded ensemble cast for his latest film, a period comedy set in 1955 about the students and parents at a Junior Stargazer convention. In other words, this might be the most Wes Anderson-y Wes Anderson movie yet.\n\n\n\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: James Mangold\nStarring: Harrison Ford, Antonio Banderas, Mads Mikkelsen, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Shaunette Ren\u00e9e Wilson, Toby Jones, Boyd Holbrook\nOpening on: June 30, 2023\nFor the first time ever, a person not named Steven Spielberg is helming an Indiana Jones film. James Mangold (Walk the Line) directs this long-awaited follow-up to 2008\u2019s Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which boasts turns by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, Shaunette Ren\u00e9e Wilson, Antonio Banderas, and, of course, Harrison Ford.\n\nJuly\n\n\nInsidious: Fear the Dark\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Patrick Wilson\nStarring: Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins, Andrew Astor, Hiam Abbass\nOpening on: July 7, 2023\nInsidious franchise star Patrick Wilson makes his feature directorial debut with this fifth installment, which takes place a decade after Insidious 2 and focuses on the Lambert family\u2019s older son Dalton (Ty Simpkins), who is terrorized by his family\u2019s demons while away at college. In addition to Wilson and Simpkins, Rose Byrne and Andrew Astor also reprise their roles to complete the Lambert family.\n\n\n\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, Part One\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Christopher McQuarrie\nStarring: Tom Cruise, Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Vanessa Kirby, Henry Czerny, Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Shea Whigham, Esai Morales\nOpening on: July 14, 2023\nThis was the slot originally reserved for\u00a0Mission: Impossible 8, but with COVID being what it is, we\u2019re now getting\u00a0M:I 7 in 2023 and\u00a0M:I 8 in 2024. In any case, when this movie hits theaters, Tom Cruise will have played Ethan Hunt for a whopping 27 years. Where does the time go? This installment brings back familiar franchise faces like Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, Henry Czerny, and Vanessa Kirby, with Esai Morales playing the primary villain.\n\nRoosevelt\nDirected by: Martin Scorsese\nStarring: Leonardo DiCaprio\nOpening on: July 14, 2023\nThe legacy of the 32nd president of the United States gets the Martin Scorsese treatment, with Leonardo DiCaprio \u2014 who else? \u2014 set to star as the leader who navigated the Great Depression and World War II. This was announced way back in 2017, and we haven\u2019t heard a whole lot about it since then, so take this release date with a grain of salt.\n\n\n\n\nBarbie\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Greta Gerwig\nStarring: Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling\nOpening on: July 21, 2023\nAfter her stellar adaptation of Little Women, director Greta Gerwig is back with this high-concept original (co-written with Noah Baumbach), which chronicles the most famous doll ever (Margot Robbie) as she\u2019s banished from Barbieland and introduced to our world.\n\n\n\n\nOppenheimer\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Christopher Nolan\nStarring: Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett, Benny Safdie\nOpening on: July 21, 2023\nChristopher Nolan\u2019s buzzed-about biopic on physicist and \u201cfather of the atomic bomb\u201d J. Robert Oppenheimer stars Cillian Murphy in the titular role, as well as Emily Blunt and Matt Damon. Like virtually all of Nolan\u2019s films, the IMAX-shot pic should be taken in on the biggest screen possible.\n\n\n\n\nHaunted Mansion\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Justin Simien\nStarring: Rosario Dawson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jared Leto, Owen Wilson, Tiffany Haddish, Danny DeVito, LaKeith Stanfield, Winona Ryder, Dan Levy\nOpening on: July 28, 2023 (formerly August 11, 2023)\nDisney\u2019s first attempt at a feature film adaptation of their Haunted Mansion theme park ride was something of a notorious flop, but that was 20 years ago, so why not try again? This time around, the story centers on a single mother (Rosario Dawson) who moves into the titular mansion with her son, then enlists the help of a priest, a paranormal investigator, a psychic, and a history professor to cleanse their new home of evil spirits.\n\nAugust\n\n\nMeg 2: The Trench\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Ben Wheatley\nStarring: Jason Statham, Sienna Guillory, Cliff Curtis\nOpening on: August 4, 2023\nIt may not have impressed the majority of critics, but 2018\u2019s The Meg was a surprise box office hit, so we\u2019re getting a sequel. One upside is that this time around the film is being directed by Ben Wheatley (Kill List, Free Fire), who has proven to be a pretty savvy genre guy in the past, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see what he can do with Jason Statham and a giant shark.\n\n\n\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Jeff Rowe\nStarring: Brady Noon, Nicolas Cantu, Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Paul Rudd, Jackie Chan, Giancarlo Esposito, Seth Rogen, John Cena, Ice Cube\nOpening on: August 4, 2023\nSeth Rogen and his frequent partner Evan Goldberg are rebooting the TMNT franchise with this new, computer-animated film that retells the origin story of the titular quartet, who emerge from the sewers to fight crime and be accepted by the city they protect. Outside of the turtles themselves, the voice cast is stacked with big names, and the animation style is reminiscent of a certain Spider-Verse movie, so it\u2019s got a lot going for it.\n\n\n\n\nGran Turismo\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Neill Blomkamp\nStarring: David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, Darren Barnet, Archie Madekwwe, Djimon Hounsou\nOpening on: August 11, 2023\nDon\u2019t be too quick to dismiss this as a standard video game adaptation, because, despite its title, it\u2019s actually a coming-of-age tale based on the true story of a teenager who won a series of video game competitions \u2014 playing the popular racing game Gran Turismo of course \u2014 en route to becoming an actual professional race car driver.\n\n\n\n\nBlue Beetle\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Angel Manuel Soto\nStarring: Xolo Maridue\u00f1a, Susan Sarandon, Harvey Guillen\nOpening on: August 18, 2023\nOriginally conceived as a film specifically for the HBO Max streaming platform,\u00a0Blue Beetle eventually found its way to being a theatrical release when Warner Bros. changed their minds about the film. The DC superhero flick will be helmed by Angel Manuel Soto (Charm City Kings) and star Xolo Maridue\u00f1a, who has recently made a name for himself on the\u00a0Karate Kid-inspired hit Netflix series Cobra Kai.\n\nSeptember\n\n\nThe Equalizer 3\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Antoine Fuqua\nStarring: Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, David Denman, Gaia Scodellaro, Sonia Ammar\nOpening on: September 1, 2023\nDirector Antoine Fuqua and star Denzel Washington return for another go in this vigilante action thriller franchise based on the classic TV series of the same name. This time, Washington reunites with his\u00a0Man on Fire co-star Dakota Fanning, though we don\u2019t yet know exactly who her character is and what the story will be.\n\n\n\nThe Nun 2\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Michael Chaves\nStarring: Bonnie Aarons\nOpening on: September 8, 2023\nThe\u00a0Conjuring Universe continues to expand, as we get a sequel to the 2018 horror film\u00a0The Nun, which starred Taissa Farmiga as a young nun who comes face-to-face with the demon Valak at her convent. The second film takes place four years later, as Farmiga\u2019s Sister Irene encounters Valak again after a priest is murdered. Bonnie Aarons, who portrayed Valak, is the only star currently attached to the film, so we have no word yet on whether or not Taissa Farmiga will also return to reprise her role.\n\n\n\nNext Goal Wins\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Taika Waititi\nStarring: Michael Fassbender, Elisabeth Moss, Will Arnett\nOpening on: September 8, 2023\nTaika Waititi takes on a decidedly more grounded film after last year\u2019s Thor: Love and Thunder in this adaptation of the 2015 documentary of the same title. The story follows Dutch-American soccer coach Thomas Rongen (Michael Fassbender), who is hired to help turn around the American Samoa national team, which is considered one of the worst in the world.\n\nOctober\n\n\nKraven the Hunter\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: J.C. Chandor\nStarring: Aaron Taylor-Johnson\nOpening on: October 6, 2023\nOriginally set to appear sometime in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man franchise before it was discontinued by Sony, the classic Spidey villain finally makes the jump to the big screen. The film will be directed by J.C. Chandor (All Is Lost,\u00a0Triple Frontier), with Aaron Taylor-Johnson (who portrayed Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver in\u00a0Avengers: Age of Ultron) set to play the character.\n\nThe Exorcist\nDirected by: David Gordon Green\nStarring: Leslie Odom Jr., Ellen Burstyn, Ann Dowd\nOpening on: October 13, 2023\nAfter capping off his trio of Halloween films, director David Gordon Green jumps right into another beloved horror franchise. As with his tackling of the Michael Myers story, The Exorcist is a follow-up to the original \u2014 and the 1973 original only \u2014 and will reportedly unfold as the first of a trilogy, with Ellen Burstyn set to reprise her starring turn.\n\n\n\nPain Hustlers\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: David Yates\nStarring: Emily Blunt, Chris Evans, Andy Garcia, Catherine O\u2019Hara, Jay Duplass\nPremiering on: October 27, 2023 on Netflix\nHarry Potter and Fantastic Beasts director David Yates delves into decidedly less fantastical territory with this based-on-true-events crime drama that centers on a woman who takes a job at a pharmaceutical start-up in Florida and finds herself at the center of a criminal conspiracy. The film stars Emily Blunt, Chris Evans, and Andy Garcia, among .\n\n\n\nSaw X\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Kevin Greutert\nStarring: Tobin Bell\nPremiering on: October 27, 2023\nJust in time for Halloween, we\u2019re getting another Saw movie. Kevin Greutert, who directed 2009\u2019s\u00a0Saw VI and 2010\u2019s\u00a0Saw 3D, is returning to helm this tenth installment in the franchise, and though we don\u2019t really know anything about the story, we do know that Tobin Bell\u2019s Jigsaw will appear in the film. If you\u2019ve been following the lore of the series thus far, that should be an interesting development.\n\nNovember\n(Photo by Warner Bros.

Olivia Colman, Sally Hawkins, Keegan Michael-Key, and Rowan Atkinson round out the grade-A cast, while Paul King, who enjoyed massive critical success with his two\u00a0Paddington films, takes the helm.\n\n\n\nThe Color Purple\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Blitz Bazawule\nStarring: Danielle Brooks, Halle Bailey, Fantasia Barrino, Taraji P.

We also know that the film\u2019s setting will indeed be New York and the firehouse from the original films, which was teased at the end of\u00a0Afterlife.\n\n\n\nRebel Moon\n(2023)\n\nDirected by: Zack Snyder\nStarring: Charlie Hunnam, Sofia Boutella, Michiel Huisman, Cary Elwes, Corey Stoll, Jena Malone, Ed Skrein, Djiman Hounsou, Dona Bae\nPremiering on: December 22, 2023 on Netflix\nAfter the success of\u00a0Army of the Dead, Zack Snyder\u2019s next project for Netflix is this space epic based on an original story of Snyder\u2019s own.

Sure, a trailer debuted at D23, but the limited series \u2014 a story Feige claimed was too big to be contained in a feature film \u2014 is still something of a dark spot in terms of information, considering the program, which he called a \u201ccrossover event series,\u201d is the next to stream on Disney+.\nNevertheless, we\u2019ve dusted off our S.H.I.E.L.D. credentials to suss out what we can about the series and why it may or may not be worthy of the few comments Feige has made about it. Take a look at the following dossier and see for yourselves if you can find the Skrulls hiding in the folds.\n\nThe Skrulls Return for\u00a0a\u00a0Secret Plot\n(Photo by Marvel Studios)\nDespite the friendliness of the Skrulls being one of the great twists contained in 2019\u2019s Captain Marvel, the alien shape-shifting race is, generally, more antagonistic in the pages of Marvel Comics. Indeed, one of their grandest schemes was detailed in the 2008 event story Secret Invasion \u2014\u00a0not to be confused with the more recent comic of the same name Marvel published in 2022. In its pages, the Avengers learned of a Skrull plot to infiltrate every level of human society, including the superhuman community, as a prelude a larger attack on the Earth. Unfortunately, the heroes learn about the scheme too late; the Skrulls have already done their work and their sleeper agents reveal themselves just as the open invasion begins.\nOf course, expect the plot of the television series to be somewhat different. As seen in the D23 trailer, former S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) returns after a few years in space to face off against a threat he claims only he can withstand \u2014 a Skrull insurgence inspired by Fury\u2019s seeming failure to find them a world of their own after 30 years. The Skrull scheme will be executed by a rebel faction not aligned with Talos (Ben Mendelsohn), which means he will still be an ally even if his sway among his people is limited. While speaking with Vanity Fair in March 2023, Jackson also said the story will revolve around some of Fury\u2019s sins, like putting the Skrulls to work as his own intelligence network, and feature a version of the former S.H.I.E.L.D. director still reeling from the deaths in Avengers: Endgame. In the same piece, executive producer Jonathan Schwartz compared the program to John le Carr\u00e9 novels and series like The Americans with similar themes of identity and loyalty.\n\nAn Invasion of the Post-Blip World\n(Photo by Marvel Studios)\nBeing the first Phase 5 television show, we can safely assume it will take place after the events of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It is a time when the Global Repatriation Council has seemingly wound down, world governments are desperate to find vibranium, and three years have past since the death of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and the Battle of Earth.\nBut as the Phase 4 shows and Wakanda Forever revealed, the world is on the brink. Tensions flare everywhere across the globe. Superpowered beings are hunted despite the repeal of the Sokovia Accords. Even without a possible alien threat, Earth is getting back to its usual, divisive business \u2014 but we can\u2019t help but wonder if some of the geopolitical fires are being stoked by the Skrull sleepers to soften the planet\u2019s resolve ahead of an all-out invasion.\nAnd even if not, will the arrival of a hostile alien force prove to the world it needs a group like the Avengers (or S.H.I.E.L.D. for that matter) to guard against situations like this?\n\nAgents of Secrets\n(Photo by Marvel Studios)\nJackson, of course, returns as Fury; in fact, the program pays off the Fury-fronted project the actor has been teasing for at least 12 years. For those watching his contract, it is unclear if this is the final appearance of his original deal or something else entirely. Also, we\u2019ll speculate that despite some heavy teasing that this may be Fury\u2019s swan song, he\u2019ll end up the director of some agency by the series\u2019 end. For one thing, Jackson says Nick has put down his eye patch because it is part of the \u201cstrong\u201d version of his character. His Captain Marvel injury remains, but having the wound on display reflects Fury\u2019s weariness. Perhaps, if he puts down the invasion, he will adopt his old badge of strength.\nOther Marvel stalwarts returning include Mendelsohn as Talos, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill \u2014 whom the actor describes as being very tired of Fury\u2019s failure to communicate while she\u2019s been putting out fires \u2014 Martin Freeman as Everett K. Ross, and Don Cheadle as James Rhodes. The latter has not been on screen since a brief scene in The Falcon and The Winter Soldier and presumably continues to liaise between the U.S. government and the superhero community. Cheadle and Feige have both mentioned Rhodey\u2019s involvement in Secret Invasion will lead into his star turn in Armor Wars, the former Disney+ series-turned-film-project said to revolve around Tony Stark\u2019s worst nightmare coming true.\nSmulders, as Maria Hill, has not been seen since Endgame \u2014 although Talos\u2019s wife, Soren (Sharon Blynn), assumed her form throughout Far From Home. As referenced above, the character spent most of Phase 4 pouring water on hot spots while Fury was away, but we\u2019re inclined to think the mention of Sharon Carter\u2019s (Emily VanCamp) \u201cold division\u201d coming back in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier may lead Hill back to her old job.\n\n(Photo by Marvel Studios)\nMendelsohn\u2019s Talos, meanwhile, has been assisting Fury this whole time; even appearing as Fury through most of No Way Home. He presumably alerted Fury to the possible threat early on, although, it remains to be seen if he knew about the secret invasion or if a heel turn awaits him.\nEverett K. Ross is the most interesting inclusion from an ongoing MCU story standpoint. Rescued by Okoye (Danai Gurira) at the end of Wakanda Forever, he is a fugitive from the U.S. government and no doubt looking to find a way to get out of trouble. Unless, of course, he was a Skrull the whole time.\n\n(Photo by Marvel Studios)\nNew actors joining the MCU for the series include\u00a0Game of Thrones\u2019 Emilia Clarke, The Crown\u2019s Olivia Colman \u2014 playing Special Agent Sonya Falsworth \u2014 Christopher MacDonald as a newly-created character who will reportedly have major implications for the MCU going forward; Kingsley Ben-Adir as Rebel Skrull leader Gravik; Killian Scott as Fiz (another potential Mutant); Dermot Mulroney as President Ritson; and both Charlayne Woodard and Carmen Ejogo in undisclosed roles. Reportedly, Noel Fisher will also appear in an unknown capacity.\nIn the March 2023 Vanity Fair piece, Colman was identified as an MI6 agent without any reference to her name while Clarke\u2019s character was revealed to be G\u2019iah, Talos\u2019s daughter from Captain Marvel all grown up and a believer in Gravik\u2019s cause. As Clarke explained to Vanity Fair, the splinter cell is frustrated Talos and Fury have failed to deliver a planet after several decades. G\u2019iah, herself, is also looking to get out from under Talos\u2019s shadow.\n\n\nWe\u2019re also going to assume a number of surprise cameos will happen throughout the series as it becomes clear who is a Skrull and who is human \u2014 Jackson claims Fury has a very good reason not to call his superhero friends in for this mission. Back in the original comic, discovering who had been replaced was part of the appeal and we doubt Marvel Studios would adapt the story without at least a handful of stunning reveals. Our suspect list is based mainly in the TV realm with people like Sharon Carter, Pug (Josh Segarra) from She-Hulk: Attorney At Law, and Ms. Marvel\u2019s Agent Deever (Alysia Reiner) as good candidates. Although, considering the way comic book readers responded to the shocking truth that the Skrull Queen replaced Spider-Woman for a good long time before Secret Invasion, at least one headlining character could also turn out to be a Skrull agent.\n\nThe Behind-the-Scenes Conspirators\n(Photo by Marvel Studios)\nKyle Bradstreet of Mr. Robot fame serves as head writer, while Thomas Bezucha (The Family Stone) and Ali Selim (In Treatment) split director duties. Feige is, of course, producing with Louis D\u2019Esposito, Brad Winderbaum, and Jonathan Schwartz also set as executive producers. Other crew include Sylvaine Dufaux and Remi Adefarasin as directors of photography, production designer Frank Walsh, costume designer Claire Anderson, editors James Stanger and Melissa Lawson Cheung, and composer Kris Bowers.\nProduction ran from September 2021 to April 2022. Reshoots occurred over the summer and early fall of 2022.\n\nWhen Does the Invasion Begin?\n(Photo by Marvel Studios)\nAfter originally being scheduled for a Spring 2021 release, Disney+ set a June 21, 2023 launch date for Secret Invasion as the Marvel calendar itself began to expand out from the PowerPoint slide Feige revealed at SDCC 2022. The timing of the series makes it the only Marvel story of the summer. November\u2019s The Marvels \u2014 originally slated for a July debut \u2014 reunites Jackson\u2019s Fury with Brie Larson\u2018s Captain Marvel and Teyonah Parris\u2018 Monica Rambeau. It also introduces Iman Vellani\u2019s Ms. Marvel (aka, Kamala Khan) on the big screen after the Certified Fresh first season of her own series.\n\nOn an Apple device?

It was previously announced that the show\u2019s upcoming eighth season will be its last and that Starz has ordered Outlander: Blood of My Blood, a prequel series centering on Jamie\u2019s parents.\n\nJust added: Secret Invasion (June 21), The Kardashians (May 25), Clone High (Spring), Jewish Matchmaking (May 3).\n\nApril\n\nSaturday, Apr. 1\n\n\n\n- -\n\n\nLove in the Maldives\n(2023)\n                 8 p.m., Hallmark  [movie]\n\n\nSunday, Apr. 2\n\n\n\n- -\n\n\nWar Sailor: Limited Series\n(2023)\n                 Netflix\n            \n\nThe Chosen, 2 p.m., UPtv\n\n\n\n- -\n\n\nViolent Minds: Killers on Tape: Season 1\n(2023)\n                 7 p.m., Oxygen\n            \n\n2023 CMT Music Awards, 8 p.m., CBS\n\n\n\n- -\n\n\nThe Hand That Robs the Cradle\n(2023)\n                 8 p.m., Lifetime  [movie]\n\n\n\n\n\n- -\n\n\nMysteries Decoded: Season 3\n(2023)\n                 8 p.m., The CW\n            \n\nVinyl Obsession: Season 2, 8:30 p.m., AXS\nUncensored: Season 6, 10 p.m., TV One\n\n\n\n- -\n\n\nRoyal Crackers: Season 1\n(2023)\n                 11 p.m., Adult Swim\n            \n\nMonday, Apr. 3\n\n\n\n90%\n\n\nPretty Baby: Brooke Shields: Season 1\n(2023)\n                 Hulu\n            \n\n\n\n\n- -\n\n\nMartha Cooks: Season 2\n(2023)\n                 The Roku Channel\n            \n\n\n\n\n- -\n\n\nThe Brokenwood Mysteries: Season 9\n(2023)\n                 Acorn TV\n            \n\n\n\n\n- -\n\n\nLa Frontera With Pati Jinich: Season 2\n(2023)\n                 9 p.m., PBS\n            \n\nWWE\u2019s Most Wanted Treasures: Season 2, 9 p.m., A&E\nStone Cold Takes on America: Season 1, 10 p.m., A&E\n\n\n\n- -\n\n\nRace to Survive: Alaska: Season 1\n(2023)\n                 11 p.m., USA Network\n            \n\nTuesday, Apr. 4\n\n\n\n- -\n\n\nSister Boniface Mysteries: Season 2\n                \n                 BritBox\n            \n\n\n\n\n- -\n\n\nThe Signing: Season 1\n(2023)\n                 Netflix\n            \n\n\n\n\n- -\n\n\nMy Name Is Mo'Nique\n(2023)\n                 8 p.m., Hallmark  [movie]\n\n\n\n\n\n- -\n\n\nRedefined: J.R.

Gates", "date": "April 1, 2023", "img": "https://prd-rteditorial.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/31192548/Safety_Last_Anniversary-Rep.jpg", "details": "\n(Photo by Path\u00e9)\nStars like Tom Cruise, Johnny Knoxville, and Michelle Yeoh are known for doing their own stunts, but the biggest stars on the silver screen have been performing their own stunts since the earliest days of cinema. In the silent era, serials and westerns \u2014 and even slapstick comedies \u2014 wowed audiences with daredevil stunts performed by the stars they loved. Unfortunately, a lot of silent films have been lost, and stunts like Ormer Locklear jumping from one plane to another in 1919\u2019s The Great Air Robbery are lost with them. But many of these films do survive \u2014 a prime example is\u00a0 Safety Last!, the Harold Lloyd silent comedy that features one of the most iconic scenes in all of cinema. The film celebrates its 100th anniversary today, and to commemorate the occasion, we look back at 10 of the most daring stunts from the era that you can still watch today.\n\nHarold Lloyd \u2013 Safety Last! (1923)\n\nDebuting exactly 100 years ago, Safety Last! features one the most iconic stunts of all time, culminating in star Harold Lloyd hanging from the face of a clock as traffic whizzes below him. In the film, hapless store clerk Lloyd is so desperate for money he decides to climb a 12-story building for $500. Lloyd and directors Fred C. Newmeyer and Sam Taylor achieved this stunt using a mixture of fa\u00e7ade sets built on actual buildings in downtown LA, mechanical effects, forced perspective, and Lloyd\u2019s comedy-tinged stunt work. He was also assisted in some of the more dangerous aspects of the stunt by a few stuntmen, including Bill Strother and Harvey Parry. The result is one of the most thrilling \u2014 and funny \u2014 moments in all of cinema.\n\u201cWhy the human race should be supposed to find entertainment and not torture in seeing another human on the point of falling to certain death is a mystery to what intelligence I possess. However, there are six reels of it, and it proved vastly entertaining.\u201d \u2014 Inez Cunningham, Chicago Tribune, May 28, 1923\n\nMabel Normand \u2013 Mickey (1918)\n\nMabel Normand, who is credited with launching Charlie Chaplin\u2019s career in America, was one of the biggest stars in the 1910s. Produced by Normand and Mack Sennett, 1918\u2019s Mickey features a breathtaking stunt in which Normand hangs onto the eaves of what was the Castle Towers Apartments in the Bunker Hill section of Los Angeles. According to SilentLocations, Normand achieved this stunt through forced perspective and match cuts. The building had two corner towers, one far off the ground and the other close to it. Using the language of cinema to trick viewers, Normand climbed the taller tower in one scene, but in a tighter match cut hangs off of the shorter one, all the while maintaining the suspense of an impending fall. Mickey became the highest-grossing film of the year.\n\u201cWhether she is falling down a well, leaping through an upper window in a ball gown or visiting New York, [Mabel Normand] is startling, vivacious, girlish, and always funny.\u201d \u2014 Julian Johnson, Photoplay, April 1919\n\nBuster Keaton \u2013 Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928)\n\nOf the silent film comedians, Buster Keaton was the biggest daredevil of them all, with each of his films filled with jaw-dropping stunts. The 1928 film Steamboat Bill, Jr. features perhaps his most iconic \u2014 during a cyclone, Keaton survives the fa\u00e7ade of an entire house falling on him via the outline of the attic window. Keaton had done iterations of this same stunt in his shorts Back Stage (1919) and One Week (1920), but here he used a genuine, two-ton building fa\u00e7ade. If he\u2019d missed his mark by an inch, he\u2019d likely have been crushed. Keaton later claimed filming this scene was the thrill of his life, but that he \u201cwas mad at the time, or I would never have done the thing.\u201d\n\u201cBuster, hardly more dazed during the cyclone than at any other time, walks out of buildings as they collapse, stands in others that blow away, gets his pants caught on an uprooted tree and is deposited in the river and has a score of other sensational experiences.\u201d \u2014 Edgar Waite, San Francisco Examiner, May 21, 1928\n\nMusidora \u2013 Les Vampieres (1915-1916)\n\nLouis Feuillade\u2019s French serial Les Vampires stars Musidora as a black catsuit-clad criminal named Irma Vep who carries out her nighttime criminal activities on the rooftops of Paris. Musidora, born Jeanne Roques, was a former acrobat and performed many of the serial\u2019s stunts herself, including a sequence in which she tumbles down the side of a tall building wrapped in an unfurling length of rope \u2014 a stunt mimicked by no less than Jackie Chan. A strident feminist, Musidora saw her work in film as a way to defy conventions. Writing for Cin\u00e9magazine years later, she stated, \u201cNo one can say I used a stand-in for the scenes that my sex entitles me to turn down.\u201d\n\u201cMost of the stunts were performed by the actors themselves. One scene shows Musidora lying on her back between railroad tracks while 52 freight cars pass over her; another has her plunging head over heels down a rope from a ninth-floor attic to the ground\u2026 The fall is seen in a single, unbroken trajectory, and whether or not this was accomplished through trickery, it is an awesome sight to behold.\u201d \u2014 Jonathan Rosenbaum, Chicago Reader, Oct. 8, 1987\n\nDouglas Fairbanks \u2013 The Black Pirate (1926)\n\nThe debonair star Douglas Fairbanks swashbuckled his way into the hearts of movie audiences around the globe in the 1920s. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint one film as the pinnacle of his action-packed filmography, but biographer Jeffrey Vance cites 1926\u2019s The Black Pirate as the most controlled stunt work of his career. In one sequence, Fairbanks slides down the sails of a pirate ship while solely holding on to a knife. The sequence has been referenced in everything from the Marx Brothers\u2019 1935 comedy A Night at the Opera to the 80s classic The Goonies. While the exact mechanics of how Fairbanks pulled off the stunt remain debated to this day, the result is as thrilling now as it was nearly a hundred years ago.\n\u201c[Fairbanks] climbs to the cross-arms and slits the big sail by jabbing it at the top with his sword and letting his own weight carry it right through to the very bottom. The execution of this feat is one of the high lights in the star\u2019s performance.\u201d \u2014 T.M. Cushing, Baltimore Sun, Jan. 4, 1927\n\nHelen Holmes \u2013 The Hazards of Helen, Ep. 13: The Escape on the Fast Freight (1915)\n\nLong before television, there were serials. These weekly features with recurring characters \u2013 often in perilous situations \u2013 were usually one- or two-reelers, or roughly 10 to 20 minutes long, and often ended with a cliffhanger. Many of the most popular serials during the 1910s starred actresses who did their own stunts, like Helen Holmes, whose series The Hazards of Helen ran for 119 episodes. Although Holmes only starred in about a third of the installments, her episodes include some of the most daring stunts, including a sequence in episode 13 where a skirt-clad Holmes leaps from a bridge onto the top of a moving train. Holmes did so many train-related stunts she was nicknamed \u201cThe Railroad Girl.\u201d\n\u201cThe thirteenth of The Hazards of Helen Railway Series is an unusually thrilling episode, and presents several dangerous ventures, such as Helen dropping an apparently dangerous height from a bridge to the top of a moving freight train.\u201d \u2014 Moving Picture World, Feb. 20, 1915\n\nHelen Gibson \u2013 The Hazards of Helen, Epi. 45: A Girl\u2019s Grit (1915)\n\nAfter Helen Holmes left to set up her own production company and a few temporary replacements were tried, stuntwoman Rose Wenger Gibson \u2014 later renamed Helen Gibson \u2014 took over The Hazards of Helen for the remainder of the series. In one episode called \u201cA Girl\u2019s Grit,\u201d Gibson leaps from the roof of a train station onto a moving train. Although she practiced the jump with the train in a standstill, when the cameras rolled she made the leap with the train in full motion, having calculated its accelerating velocity to the second. For her stunt work in this and many other serials, Gibson earned the title \u201cthe most daring actress in pictures.\u201d\n\u201cThe title of this one-reel addition to the \u2018hazard\u2019 series is not misleading. The audience is given its accustomed amount of thrill by the girl telegrapher, and the entire picture is cunningly devised to lead up to the big stunt.\u201d \u2014 Moving Picture World, Oct. 2, 1915\n\nGrace Cunard \u2013 The Purple Mask, Ep. 13 Part 1: The Leap (1916)\n(Photo by John Springer Collection/Getty Images)\nAlthough not as well remembered today as some of her fellow serial queens, writer-director-producer-editor-actress Grace Cunard (born Harriet Mildred Jeffries) and collaborator Francis Ford (elder brother of acclaimed director John Ford), starred in five of Universal\u2019s most popular serials, including The Purple Mask. The duo became some of the first internationally acclaimed action stars, with their films topping the box office in countries around the globe like Australia, Czechoslovakia, Mexico, Japan, and India. In episode 13 of The Purple Mask, Cunard, clad in head-to-toe black velvet (and a cape!), climbs a tall building via its drain pipe, fights off a gang of revolutionaries, then makes a dashing exit back down the pipe. Although she was one of the few women directors at the time, she preferred writing and was known as \u201cThe Master Pen.\u201d\n\u201cRealism is served a la Ford and Cunard. With its fights, its Paris sewers, its abbreviated feminine costumes and its action which is furious if not always progressive, The Purple Mask looms up as a big box-office attraction.\u201d \u2014 Peter Milne, Motion Picture News, Dec. 30, 1916\n\nPearl White \u2013 The Perils of Pauline, Ep. 6 (1914)\n\nDubbed \u201cQueen of the Serials,\u201d actress Pearl White began appearing on stage at the age of six and worked as a bareback rider in the circus at age 13. She\u2019s probably best known now for starring in the 1914 box office smash The Perils of Pauline. This incredibly popular serial consisted of 20 two-reel installments and made White an international celebrity. In one installment, White finds herself aloft in a wayward hot air balloon, later having to climb out of it via rope before it collides with a cliff. In a 1921 interview, White said of her daring stunt work, \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of feeling fear. But I would be ashamed if I let my fear rule me.\u201d\n\u201cIt is hard to class thrills which allow only a small margin for safety, but if there is such a thing as supremacy in them, the sixth episode of The Perils of Pauline offers some likely-looking candidates.\u201d \u2014 Motography, June 13, 1914\n\nYakima Canutt \u2013 The Devil Horse (1926)\n\nBorn in 1896 in Colfax, Washington, Yakima Canutt worked as ranch hand from his early childhood and began breaking horses at age 12. Before coming to Hollywood in the 1920s, he broke horses for the army during WWI and was a five-time winner of the title World\u2019s Champion All-Round Cowboy. Although best known today for his stunt double work in westerns like John Ford\u2019s 1939 epic Stagecoach, during the silent era he starred in several films, including 1926\u2019s The Devil Horse, about a man-killing black stallion named Rex. The horse, known alternatively as \u201cThe Wonder Horse\u201d and \u201cThe King of the Wild Horses,\u201d was so ornery that Canutt reportedly had its wranglers tie his wrists and ankle around the horse\u2019s body so he wouldn\u2019t be bucked.\n\u201cThe Devil Horse, reel for reel, is as filled with thrilling situations and incidents as possible. Yakima Canutt, the world\u2019s champ cowboy and a riding fool, is the young hero. What he lacks in movie looks he makes up for in his rough riding.\u201d \u2014 Robert F.

We\u2019re still waiting on X-Men news, but Fantastic Four has been in development for most of those five years, including a period when the attached director was Jon Watts, who directed the three Spider-Man movies starring Tom Holland. Last year, Matt Shakman (WandaVision) took over, and at the time, the writers tapped for the film were a younger duo mostly known for their comedy scripts. Now, with the Fantastic Four release date (2/14/2025) less than two years away, Marvel has hired a new screenwriter, Josh Friedman, who is more known for his big action movies, in particular for working on Avatar: The Way of Water. Marvel Studios has not yet announced any stars to play the Fantastic Four, or the film\u2019s villains.\n\nOther Top Headlines\n\n1. QUESTLOVE TO DIRECT DISNEY\u2019S LIVE-ACTION THE ARISTOCATS\n(Photo by Robert Smith/Getty Images)\nDisney\u2019s ongoing campaign to remake most of their classic animated films as either live-action or live-action/CGI hybrids is still moving right along, with the year 2023 set to bring us Peter Pan & Wendy (4/28/2023) and The Little Mermaid (5/26/2023), and other projects in the works like Hercules, Lilo & Stitch, and Snow White. We can also now add the 1970 movie The Aristocats (Fresh at 63%) to that list with the news that Disney has hired director Ahmir Thompson, aka Questlove, to direct a remake, which is expected to be a hybrid of live action and CGI characters in the style of movies like Sonic the Hedgehog and Disney\u2019s Chip \u2018n Dale: Rescue Rangers.\n\n\n2. MEGAN THEE STALLION JOINS ADAM SANDLER\u2019S NEXT FILM BY THE SAFDIE BROTHERS\n(Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images)\nDirectors Josh and Benny Safdie, aka the Safdie brothers, are preparing their next film for Netflix after their Academy Award-nominated film Uncut Gems (Certified Fresh at 91%), which starred Adam Sandler. Their next film doesn\u2019t yet have a title, but Sandler, who is also reuniting with the Safdies on the film, has disclosed that the premise involves sports memorabilia. The first new cast member confirmed is rapper-turned-actor Megan Thee Stallion, who recently had a small role on Disney+\u2019s She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (Fresh at 80%). (Some sites are also running the news of a former DCEU star joining this project, but that casting hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet, so we will keep that actor unnamed for now.)\n\n\n3. CHRIS PINE JOINS VOICE CAST OF DISNEY\u2019S WISH\n(Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/Getty Images)\nLast year\u2019s Strange World, officially the 61st feature film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, was basically a box office bomb, but the studio has higher hopes for movie\u00a0 No. 62, Wish (11/22/2023), starring Ariana DeBose and Alan Tudyk. This week, Disney also added Chris Pine to the voice cast, just before Pine has what is expected to be a big box office weekend with Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (Certified Fresh at 90%). Ariana DeBose will play a girl whose life is changed when she \u201cwishes upon a star,\u201d a la Pinocchio, but Chris Pine\u2019s role has not yet been disclosed.\n\n\n4. SAMARA WEAVING RECRUITED FOR 1980S-STYLE ACTION THRILLER BELLA\n(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)\nSamara Weaving may not yet be a household name, but she has stayed quite busy since her breakout role in Ready or Not (Certified Fresh at 88%), appearing in films like Bill & Ted Face the Music, Babylon, and Scream VI. This week, Paramount Pictures recruited Weaving to star in a 1980s-set action thriller called Bella, which is being described as \u201chyperstylized,\u201d as a cop\u2019s daughter who goes on a rampage in New York City following a vicious assault on her father.\n\n\n5. LIV TYLER RETURNING TO THE MCU AFTER 15 YEARS AWAY\n(Photo by Gregg DeGuire/Getty Images)\nEven die hard fans of the MCU might be shocked to be reminded that Liv Tyler actually had the second lead role, after Edward Norton, in the franchise\u2019s second film, The Incredible Hulk (Fresh at 67%), in which she played Bruce Banner\u2019s long-time girlfriend in the comics, Betsy Ross. That character was the daughter of General \u201cThunderbolt\u201d Ross, who is going to return in a more prominent role in next year\u2019s Captain America: New World Order (5/3/2024), with the character now being played by Harrison Ford, following the death of William Hurt. With that in mind, Liv Tyler is indeed set to reprise her role as Betsy Ross in the film, which will return her to the MCU for the first time in over 15 years. In related news, a new screenwriter was also hired this week to work on Marvel\u2019s Thunderbolts (7/26/2024).\n\n\n6.

CLINT EASTWOOD ANNOUNCES HIS FINAL FILM AS DIRECTOR\n(Photo by Keith Bernstein/Warner Bros.)\nThere is one very specific bit of trivia that sets Quentin Tarantino at the opposite end of a spectrum from Clint Eastwood. At the age of 60, Tarantino is talking about his next film, The Movie Critic, being his last project as director. Meanwhile, Eastwood, who is 32 years older, is only now announcing his final film. The film, which will be made for Warner Bros. like much of Eastwood\u2019s catalog, is expected to be a legal drama called Juror #2, about a murder trial juror who discovers that he might actually be the killer in the case.\n\n\n9. UNIVERSAL TO REMAKE MST3K FAVORITE THE MOLE PEOPLE\n(Photo by Everett Collection)\nMany movie fans and critics alike have written that they think the best candidates for remakes are movies that were flawed the first time around. Some of the very best candidates for remakes, then, might be the feature films that were satirized on the classic \u201criffing\u201d TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000 (Fresh at 87%), and that\u2019s exactly what Universal Pictures is now developing. Universal has hired screenwriter Chris Winterbauer to work on a modernized remake of the studio\u2019s 1956 monster movie The Mole People (Rotten at 43%), which was featured in the third episode of season 8 of MST3K. The original film centered on a pair of archaeologists who discover a race of ancient Sumerians who migrated underground centuries ago.\n\nOn an Apple device?

The X-Files\u00a0dealt with a\u00a0central conspiracy, but now the world is so full of conspiracies that I think that it would be a different show.\u201d\nCarter then dropped the news of Coogler\u2019s new take on the program: \u201cI just spoke to a young man, Ryan Coogler, who is going to remount\u00a0The X-Files with a diverse cast. So, he\u2019s got his work cut out for him because we covered so much territory.\u201d\nThe X-Files starred David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson as government agents solving otherworldly cases, while constantly searching for the truth. The series originally aired on Fox from 1993 to 2002, spawned two movies, and returned to the network with a 10th and 11th season dropping in 2016 and 2018, respectively.\n\n While Lotus Heads to Thailand for Season 3\n(Photo by HBO)\nMike White\u2019s \u00a0hit HBO series The White Lotus is heading to Thailand, sources close to the production revealed to Variety.\nWhite previously alluded that the third installment of the anthology would head to Asia, saying in the \u201cUnpacking S2 E7\u201d tied to the finale of season 2, \u201cThe first season kind of highlighted money, and then the second season is sex,\u201d White said in a clip pegged at the end of the season 2 finale. \u201cI think the third season would be maybe a satirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality. It feels like it could be a rich tapestry to do another round at White Lotus.\u201d\nProduction on the new season hasn\u2019t started yet, meaning the story and cast have not been revealed.

(Deadline)\n\nGLAAD Report: LGBTQ Representation on TV Slightly Lower in 2022-2023 Season\n\nAccording to GLAAD\u2019s 18th annual \u201cWhere We Are on TV\u201d report, LGBTQ representation on television is down. Counted in the report are 596 regular and recurring LGBTQ characters who appear (or will appear) on shows across broadcast, cable, and streaming from June 1, 2022 through to May 31, 2023. The previous year found 637 LGBTQ characters appearing on television, marking -6.44percent decrease.\nRepresentation is still thriving on streaming, with 356 LGBTQ characters appearing on Apple TV+, Amazon Prime, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, Peacock, and Paramount+. There were decreases across the board on broadcast in the percentage of LGBTQ series regulars from the previous report. That said, The CW still holds the top spot 14.8% of all series regulars being LGBTQ. Still, that is down -2.3 percent. The changed ownership of the network is acknowledged as a potential cause for the dip.\nOf LGBTQ characters, 175 (29 percent of the 596) will not be returning due to multiple reasons: their shows are ending, a character is dying or leaving a show, or a program that features LGBTQ characters is presented in a miniseries/anthology format. Of that number, 140 characters will disappear due to series cancellations or their respective shows coming to an end.\nYou can view the full \u201cWhere We Are on TV\u201d report here.\n\nOn an Apple device?

That could be because we have some very interesting films that look great but span very different genres, from a family-friendly animated video game movie to a historical sports drama and at least one movie that defies easy categorization. \u00a0Read on for the most anticipated movies of April 2023!\n\n\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\n(2023)\n\n\n#1 on Twitter and YouTube, #2 on Facebook and Instagram\nRelease Date: April 5\nThe race for No. 1 this week was a bit of a toss-up between three movies, but one in particular just nudged out the other two, and that, unsurprisingly, was Universal and Illumination\u2019s highly anticipated new animated film based on Nintendo\u2019s favorite plumber. Sure, there was some grumbling about Chris Pratt voicing Mario, but the animation looks gorgeous, fans have been waiting for the film for a long time, and there is so much good will built up around this character and the world he inhibits that it could only end up at the top of this month\u2019s list.\n\n\n\nEvil Dead Rise\n(2023)\n\n\n#1 on Facebook, #2 on YouTube, #3 on Instagram and Twitter\nRelease Date: April 21\n\nThere was a very small margin between No. 2 and No. 3 on this month\u2019s list, but in the end, this new chapter in the Evil Dead franchise prevailed. The 2013 reboot earned something of a cult following, but no one could have expected the reception this film got when it premiered at SXSW in March. So far, the film, which focuses on a pair of estranged sisters who are terrorized by \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a demonic book of the occult, is a hit with critics and hopefully should make for a worthy addition to the series.\n\n\n\nBeau Is Afraid\n(2023)\n\n\n#1 on Instagram, #2 on Twitter, #3 on Facebook, #4 on YouTube\nRelease Date: April 21\nComing in right on the heels of Evil Dead Rise is this curiosity from Ari Aster, a director who, in fact, has himself made his name in horror. We\u2019re not quite sure what to make of Beau Is Afraid, however; it appears to pull from multiple genres, including horror, to deliver its decades-spanning tale of a man named Beau (Joaquin Phoenix) simply making the journey home to see his mother. The combination of Aster and Phoenix alone makes this a must-see, but the trippy visuals and surreal tone of the film make it that much more intriguing.\n\n\n\nAir\n(2023)\n\n\n#4 on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter; #5 on YouTube\nRelease Date: April 5\n\nBen Affleck and Matt Damon reunite for this based-on-true-events sports drama about the men who worked for Nike back in the early \u201980s when the burgeoning shoe company was looking to sign a certain signature athlete to its new line of basketball shoes. This is another film that debuted at South by Southwest and earned massive rave reviews, and the combination of the talent involved and the pop culture cachet of the subject matter have propelled it to No. 4 on our list.\n\n\n\nRenfield\n(2023)\n\n\n#3 on YouTube, #5 on Instagram\nRelease Date: April 14\n\nComing in at the final slot of this month\u2019s list is another genre-bender, though this one leans a bit more into the \u201ccomedy\u201d of its horror-comedy. Nicholas Hoult stars as the eponymous Renfield, the assistant to Nicolas Cage\u2019s Count Dracula, who\u2026 Let\u2019s be honest: The phrase \u201cNicolas Cage\u2019s Count Dracula\u201d probably tells you almost everything you need to know to determine whether or not to watch the film. Just be aware that, despite its seemingly fun and silly trappings, you\u2019re going to see some gory stuff. You know, the \u201chorror\u201d part of the horror-comedy.\n\nThumbnail by \u00a9Universal Pictures\nOn an Apple device?

None of its sequels lasted longer than a single week at No. 1 due to competition, and the latest franchise attempt is likely to suffer the same fate next week as a new video game adaptation takes over. Nevertheless, March produced three $100+ million grossers, two of which are headed over $150 million and one that\u2019s still shooting for $200 million. Will they be joined by a fourth? The new Dungeons & Dragons film certainly has its supporters from both its fandom and even critics, but its opening numbers likely aren\u2019t impressing those who put up the dough for it.\n\nKing of the Crop: D&D: Honor Among Thieves Dethrones\u00a0John Wick\n\nSo what are we to make of a $38.5 million weekend by Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves? Fans of number-watching got excited on Friday morning when some reported a $5.6 million take in Thursday previews. Those would have been the best Thursday numbers of the year. Alas, those reports buried the lede that $1.5 million of that was from earlier previews. Thus the potential estimates for a huge weekend were dashed. Still, those are better numbers than Shazam! Fury of the Gods, right? Well, yes and no.\nYes, $38.5 million is a higher number than the $30 million that DC dud limped out of the gate with (and certainly higher than the $33.9 million the 2000 attempt at this franchise made \u2013 and that\u2019s globally). On the other hand, an extra $8.5 million is not much to write home about when your film costs anywhere from $26-41 million more than one that is already poised to be one of the biggest bombs of 2023. It\u2019s all up to fans now to spread word of mouth, especially overseas where this film really needs to be saved.\nThe numbers this weekend put Honor Among Thieves behind the company of three late March releases \u2013 Ready Player One ($41.7 million opening), G.I. Joe: Retaliation ($40.5 million), and 2017\u2019s Power Rangers ($40.3 million). That latter comes up a lot when measuring franchise failures, as it barely doubled its opening weekend towards a $85.3 million gross. Spielberg\u2019s film and the G.I. Joe sequel domestically grossed $137.6 million and $122.5 million, respectively. They also had solid international hauls of $445.2 million and $253.2 million. Yet, with their budgets of $175 million & $130 million, they were still considered disappointments overall. Somewhere in there are the numbers that the $151 million-budgeted D&D needs to turn a theatrical profit; so far, it has grossed just $71.5 million worldwide.\n\nThe Top 10 and Beyond: John Wick: Chapter 4 and\u00a0Scream VI Set Sights on Franchise Milestones\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4 fell 61.8% in its second weekend down to $28.2 million; that\u2019s just a bit over Chapter 3\u2019s $24.5 million over its second frame. Currently, the fourth chapter is at $122.8 million and about $21 million ahead of its predecessor\u2019s pace. Chapter 3 ultimately finished with $171 million, putting the new film on a very narrow path to $200 million. If it wants to keep chugging ahead of the last film\u2019s pace, it will need to earn at least around $15 million next week. Chapter 4 now owns the 12th-best 10-day total for a film released in March, but it\u2019s also behind the pace of Jordan Peele\u2019s Us, which had a $33.2 million second outing and $127.8 million after 10 days to finish with $175 million. Us dropped off further in weekend three, so if the word of mouth is out there, Wick can push further, but right now it\u2019s looking like it will land somewhere between $180-195 million. In the meantime, it is over $245 million worldwide.\nCreed III made another $5 million in its fifth weekend, bringing its total up to $148.5 million (and over $255 million worldwide). The film is still falling off the pace of Kong: Skull Island but could still tiptoe its way to just over $160 million. Scream VI is just shy of the $100 million line, which it will cross this week and ultimately land between $105-110 million to make it the highest-domestic-grossing film in the franchise. With $143 million worldwide, it still needs another $30 million to top the global gross of the 1996 original.\n\nTucked into third this week is a release from faith-based Angel Studios called His Only Son, about the story of Abraham being called to sacrifice his son, Isaac. $5.5 million went into the collection plate a week before Easter. That outgrossed Zachary Levi in Shazam! Fury of the Gods in just its third weekend; it made $4.6 million, bringing its total to $53.4 million. Another DC Zach \u2013 Snyder, that is \u2013 debuted in 2004 with his remake of Dawn of the Dead, which had a $4.5 million third weekend.
